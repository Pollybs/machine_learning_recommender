<h1> Machine Learning Project: Natural language processing (NLP) | Recipes Recommender </h1>

In this project, I built a model that can recommend vegan and vegetarian recipes, based on input from another recipe (omnivore or vegetarian). 
The model was built using Natural Language Processing (NLP): CountVectorizer and Cosine_similarity

1 - First, the data was gathered using web scraping (Beautiful Soup and Selenium) and flat files from Kaggle.
2 - Secondly, the data was cleaned, processed, and added to a normalized MySQL Database

This final project also included collecting data from Big Query (Google Cloud), from API, and building an API to expose the data collected.
